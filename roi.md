# ROI Model

This ROI is **code‑driven** from the synthetic dataset generated by `scripts/generate_fake_logs.py`.

## Assumptions
- **Unit compute cost**: $0.00002 per CPU‑second.
- **Retry penalty**: +10% CPU‑time per retry.
- **Labor displacement**: Manual processing averages **45 seconds per batch**; automation reduces to **0 seconds** of manual touch per successful batch (operator handles only failures).
- **Operator handling**: Each failed batch consumes **3 minutes** to investigate.
- **Downtime avoided**: Stable p95 ≤ 0.30s implies no bottleneck for upstream; we quantify this as 0.5 minutes saved per 100 batches due to quicker reconciliation.
- **Time window**: Last 6 hours of activity (10,000 synthetic rows).

## Method
We compute:
- Transactions processed, success & fail ratios.
- CPU time consumed (with retry penalty).
- Cost per transaction.
- Labor minutes saved (manual vs. automated; plus failure handling cost).
- Projections at 5×, 10×, 100× volumes based on current mix.
